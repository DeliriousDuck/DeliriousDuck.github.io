        <h2>My name is Chase Cuccia and my current career goal is to become some sort of computer engineer/ developer.</h2>
        <p1 class="paragraph1">
            When I was young I have always loved playing games and continue to play them unitl this day. 
            Since that is my favorite hobby, I have decided to figure out how they were made, which led me coding and computer science.
            I plan to obtain the knowledge to develop and create new types of games for people to enjoy.

           I have exactly no skill or experience in this field yet, 
           that is why I am taking computer science this year and hoping to take computer principals next year
           for more experience. Even though I am inexperienced, I am very adaptable so I should be able 
           to learn relatively easy. But I am also pretty lazy so I have not done any school actiivities or sports yet.
           What I learned about myself from my experiences is that I am really good with my hands, that being either
           drawing, playing basketball, or even building items.
