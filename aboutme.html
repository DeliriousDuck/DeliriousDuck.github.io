            Since I was young I have always loved playing videogames and continue to play them unitl this day.
            Since that is my favorite hobby, I have decided to figure out how they were made, which led me coding and computer science.
            I plan to obtain the knowledge to develop and create new types of games for people to enjoy.

           I have exactly no skill or experience in this field yet,
           that is why I am taking computer science this year and hoping to take computer principals next year
           for more experience. Even though I am inexperienced, I am very adaptable so I should be able
           to learn relatively easy. But I am also pretty lazy so I have not done any school actiivities or sports yet.
           What I learned about myself from my experiences is that I am really good with my hands, that being either
           drawing, playing basketball, or even building items.

            So that pretty much sums up my character. Thank you for taking your time to read about me.
            Please go ahead and check out the rest of my site.
