You decide that school is not important and you should drop out and pursue your passion of becoming a master chef. You get a job at The Burger Place in order to learn the basics of working with others in a restaurant setting.

When you are making fries you are usually idle at the fry machine in the back of the restaurant waiting for them to cook.

The time you spend not cooking fries is spent cleaning up messes in the dining area where the customers eat their meals.
